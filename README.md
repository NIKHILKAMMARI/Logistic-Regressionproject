# Logistic-Regressionproject
The world health organisation estimated 12 millions death records.one of them half of the death results is fount in us. the research scholor point-out the most relevent risk factor of heart attack, as the data science engineer predict the overall risk using machine learn algorithm called as logistic regression

**_PRIJECT TITLE_** :
To Predict the Heart attack disease for organization (WHO:World Health Organization) using machine learning algorithm rate of heart attack disease will increasing manner or decreasing manner

**_PROJECT STATEMENT_** :
The world health organisation estimated 12 millions death records.one of them half of the death results is fount in us. the research scholor point-out the most relevent risk factor of heart attack, as the data science engineer predict the overall risk using machine learn algorithm called as logistic regression

Task1:
Import the requried library which is required for prediction

Task2:
Import the dataset using our workspace.

Task3:
Use the appropriate of sklearn library to train,test and split the dataset

Task4:
fit your values with a range function using future scalling

Task5:
check your model accurecy and precetion using confusion matrix

conclusion :
Accrding to the model analysis the LogisticRegression algorithm work sucessfully with 0.6 accurecy. the accurecy shows that buliding the model is sucessfull.
